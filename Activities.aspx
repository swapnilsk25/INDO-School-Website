				<p>Art stimulates the imagination. To watch a child completely engrossed in arts is to recognize that the brain is active and driven by aesthetics and emotions, to make meaning, state opinions, and represent what matters to them.
Our ART curriculum emphasizes  the development of a child’s fine motor skills i.e. the development of a child’s body and mind coordination, which takes place at a particular age when a child is going through the EYP phase.

				<p>Trips and Expeditions organized at INDO SCHOOL are a golden opportunity for the students since this is one chance where the child is exposed to numerous challenges, experiences, and learnings. Not only do they get to explore an entire world in front of them, but moving out of their comfort zone also allows them to learn flexibility and adjustment. The journey to being the brightest minds of the world calls for the right exposure, which is what we are facilitating to our students</p>

  <h3>LIBRARY PROGRAMME</h3>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="https://www.visualsstock.com/images/Low/5/AK61325.jpg" alt="">
				<p>Books open up an entire world of stories, imagination, and wonder! Reading adds value to life, exercises the brain, and hone a child’s critical thinking abilities, which is why we emphasize inculcating reading habits in our children. Our Library Programme encourages inquisitiveness in children and has been designed to meticulously ingrain reading habits in them by exposing them to a wide range of genres, allowing them to experience each in a balance and discover their favorite.
