										  Just as parents are teachers at home, teachers are parents in school.
                                          Our teachers are not just limited to classroom teaching, but play a bigger role in each child’s life. A teacher is not only teaching her subject to the students but also constantly teaching her students, values and life lessons that a parent would want to impart in them. 
                                           Teachers look after academic as well as personal care of the child by making sure the child doesn’t face any difficulty, be it physically, or psychologically. It is not just teachers in INDO but an entire team of teachers, counselors, nutritionists, coordinators, didis, who are always looking out for our children, giving them the personal attention they require at school when their parents are not around.
